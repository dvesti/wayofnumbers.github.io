It is a new paper get accepted into EMLNP about generating deep fake comments according to a title and the article. There is already a lot of discussions about the ethical implication of this. Since it is a paper developed by Chinese researchers, as a Chinese myself, I think I can probably read more into it given that I'm more in the context of the Chinese online community and what are the possible uses of this new technology. Like Censoring, But More Aggressive Generating deep fake comments is somewhat the opposite of censoring, in a bad way. Instead of blocking/removing information you don't want , it generates/adds information that you do want . Censoring sometimes is not easy to spot, say your content is not recommended on YouTube or your tweet is hard to search on Twitter for some reason. These all happen in the background and usually done by algorithms. You don't know exactly what happened. A lot of the times, censoring has plausible deniability. Also, nobody can censor you if you don't put content up, so it's passive. But deep fake comments are different. It's more in-your-face, everybody can see it and they don't have to wait for you to post anything to act on it. It can flood your channel or timeline and render the real message/information less obvious. Compare to censoring, which is a passive way to shaping public opinions, deep fake comments is a very aggressive way to create some ‘artificial trends' in an effort of engineering people's view on certain things. It could be some movie reviews, it can also be some report on social events to spin what happened. Nonetheless, the potential impact is big. Fine-Grained, yet Massive in Scale Photo by hue12 photography on Unsplash Deep fake comments might be in the early stage of development, but it has the potential of being fine-grained in quality and massive in quantity. The recent development in NLP often leverage transfer learning in training models with fewer data and more quickly. Researchers can utilize currently pre-trained model like the one trained on Wikipedia as a base, and fine-tune more specific models to gain state-of-the-art results much quicker with fewer data. The pre-trained model already knows how English as a language work overall, just needs to learn how certain type of English is spoken (e.g. Reddit, or IMDB movie comments). Utilizing transfer learning, deep fake comments have the potential of quickly developing multiple models for many niches and achieve fine-grained quality, generating very relevant and ‘real' comments on different areas. Also, since it doesn't rely on human intervention (like the ‘ 50-cents Party ' in Chinese Internet), theoretically you can have thousands of scripts, running slightly different styled models and generating comments trying to push the same agenda. Think of how well Google's targeted ads can do, and you'll have an idea of how much potential this ‘targeted comments' has. I would even go so far as claiming it could be some kind of ‘weapon' in some sense. In an Internet where no one knows you are a dog , people stopped trusting articles since it can be crafted to convince you buying some products or pushing some agenda, but people by and large still trust comments, thinking it's more human and more private thus more trustworthy. Now with the deep fake comments, even the comments cannot be trusted. What else on the Internet is still legit then? All Hope has Not Lost, Yet Having discussed all the scary indications of the deep fake comments can have. It's not without weakness. As we all know that comments alone won't have much influence if it cannot form a high-quality conversation. It's the exchange of idea and emotion that really touches people. One comments, no matter how ‘real' or ‘relevant' it is, won't have the optimum impact. When real people replied on the comment and expect a clever or powerful reply back, the algorithm will most likely fall short, at least for now. This is why a lot of the chatbot or ‘Siri' like voice assistants have not gone mainstream yet. Being able to address this challenge is to say the AI has already passed the Turing Test , which is a very high bar and I don't believe we are there yet. Google's Duplex is currently the closest , but still not quite. So for now, I think the algorithm could create a lot of hassle, but cannot really touch people and have a very deep impact. Yet. What Can We Do I honestly don't know the answer to this. We can regulate the development and publication of this kind of technology, or we can foster self-discipline like what OpenAI was doing with their famous GPT -2 model (a respective move and should be encouraged, though far from solving the bigger issue though). Another way is to accept that the algorithm will be developed one way or another, and try to developed a counter- AI to detect the deep-fakes, like what Facebook and Google are doing right now. If we can detect the deep-fake, we can censor the deep-fake, right? Right? What do you think is the best way to deal with this? Please leave your comments (No Deep Fake Please!) below.

As of now, his YouTube channe l has 692K subscribers which is something. His content has a very broad reach. His ‘Doing X in 5 minutes' tutorial videos are so popular, there is a meme for that: But recently, he ran into some problems. It's with his new course ‘Making Money with Machine Learning' that he charges $200 for it. Charging $200 for a course is totally fine, the controversial part of it is that people were complaining that he used some code from other people's GitHub repo and also he accepted way more students than he promised and can properly handle without downgrading the experience. When some people seeking for refund, they also ran into some hiccups. ‘Growth Hacks' vs ‘Growing Pain' Some people accused him of fraud, I'm not so sure about that. This to me looks more like an honest mistake due to lack of experience in scaling up and entering into a field he is not familiar with. See, most of his more popular videos are entry-level tutorials with a bit of ‘entertainment' (rap, parody, etc.) elements to it. He is very natural at that and that makes AI or Machine Learning not that boring or scary. And I believe that's why people like his content the most. However, when it comes to more serious education, especially when you want to charge $200 for it, people expect certain standards and he might not be fully aware of what those standards are. For example, you need to own your content, if you want to use other's contents like code snippet or diagrams, give credit, and very proper credit at that. I remember when fast.ai's Jeremy Howard was teaching the ‘ Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders ' course. He used an ‘overfitting vs underfitting' diagrams, and he credited it as from Quora. Photo Credit: Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. But turns out, the above image originally came from Andrew Ng 's Stanford Machine Learning course . So Jeremy Howard actually specifically corrected this error on his next lecture and went out of his way and praised Andrew Ng teaching style. I think this is the respective way of handling this. I don't think Siraj Raval is intentionally not giving out credit, he might not be so used to the academia convention of giving references, etc. People won't complain about it if you are doing free videos on YouTube and used their code, but if you try to charge for the content on a formal educational program, that's a totally different animal. On the accuse of taking too many students than he promised, I think it is mostly a scaling challenge. When the success hit you too fast and you are not prepared, you most definitely will stumble. It is understandable. However, how you handle it afterward is what will make all the difference. You can either get more help or properly refund people for the level of service you fail to live up to, just don't run away from it or trying to solve a mistake with more mistakes. This will at least save the reputation and get a second chance to make things right. Final Thoughts The situation is still developing and we'll see how he handles this. I'd like to say we give him the benefit of doubt. This guy did a lot for the AI community, helped people get started with AI / ML and made a lot of people laugh after all. My suggestion? Directly face the issue, acknowledge that he made a mistake and compensate people properly, then make a video on YouTube on how he handles scaling and did damage control! Turning crisis into opportunity. Take a page from The Tech Lead's playbook. Gotta monetize whenever you can, right?","tags":"Machine Learning","url":"when-growth-hack-meets-growing-pain.html"},{"title":"How I Migrated My Blog from GitHub Pages to Netlify","text":"Things to consider when blogging as a data scientist Migrating Pelican site from GitHub Pages to Netlify The motivation Today I came across Rachel Thomas 's story of ‘ **Why you (yes, you) should blog **'. She brought up a great point that all data scientists should have their own blog. She further explained that blogging helps you clear your thoughts, spread knowledge and get noticed. All great points and I wholeheartedly agree. So I wanted to share my recent blogging experience and hope it can provide some insights into what it takes and why it is rewarding to do this. The Settlement I've had my own blog for some time now. Starting my first blog post on WordPress.com, I stumbled along the way across multiple platforms, trying to find a good home for my thoughts and feelings. About a year ago, I settled on using Pelican (a Python-based static site generator) to generate my content, then host it on GitHub Pages . It all works pretty well. Python is an easy to write yet very powerful programming language. Also as a data scientist, you are very likely to live with Python every day. So among all the static site generators , I picked Pelican, which is quite mature and regularly maintained. It also supports tons of themes and plugins . (I've even developed a Pelican plugin that calculates the article read time like Medium and get pulled into the main branch. ). It supports Jupyter Notebooks which is also a plus for data scientists. GitHub Pages is a very popular, free hosting service generously offered by GitHub . It's based on Ruby's Jekyll framework but you don't have to use it. This solution is totally free and somewhat easy to maintain. Once you set everything up, you only need to focus on putting content and running a simple script to push it to GitHub and it will automatically make it live. I used it to blog for a while. All seems fine. (Note: Anyone wants to know more about how to do this, you can check this detailed blog post .) The Struggle Then came the struggle. Somehow I cannot figure out how to make the SEO work. I exposed the ‘master' branch on GitHub and also my blog site, and Google think it's duplicate content and gave pretty bad rankings. It seems to be quite hard to get any traffic. Also as a free ‘side' service provided by GitHub, there really isn't a lot of features for hosting on GitHub Pages. As outlined in this page by Netlify, it's OK when you start blogging, but when you try to get more serious of your work, GitHub Pages just won't cut it. Image Credit: Netlify.com The Strife So I decided to migrate to Netlify, which is also free, but offer way more features and if I want to scale up in the future, there are plenty of paid plans out there. Getting Pelican Ready Since I already have my Pelican site ready on GitHub, most of the work is done. (If you haven't set up Pelican site yet, you can follow this tutorial . ) I still need to make some changes to the site so Netlify can smoothly connect to my GitHub account and pull the site to deploy. Dependencies: First of all, Netlify will need to set up the necessary dependencies so it can build my site. This requires me to provide a requirements.txt file under the site GitHub repo. To do that, I created a Python virtual environment for it: $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install virtualenv # install virtualenv $ cd ~/ git / wayofnumbers . github . io / $ virtualenv venv - p python3 . 6 # create a virtualenv for Python 3 . 6 $ source venv / bin / activate # activate the virtual env I also added venv/ in your .gitignore file so GitHub won't sync it. Once the virtual env is ready, I installed only the necessary packages as follows: $ pip install -U --force-reinstall pip $ pip install pelican Markdown typogrify ipython beautifulsoup4 nbconvert Now that the dependencies are all installed on my local virtual environment, I used the following command to generate the requirements.txt : $ pip freeze > requirements.txt CNAME : I created a CNAME file that contains my custom domain name( ‘wayofnumbers.com') under the root folder of the repo. I also put the following lines in my pelicanconf.py file to ensure the CNAME file is copied to the root of the output directory: STATIC_PATHS = [ '../CNAME' ] EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = { '../CNAME' : { 'path' : 'CNAME' }} Plugins and Themes: Then it's time to deal with plugins and themes. I copied the plugins and theme (folders) I use into the repo and set the pelicanconf.py file to point to those since on Netlify build time it needs to have access to them within the repo. Runtime.txt: Netlify needs a runtime.txt to decide which Python version to use for building the site. So I created a runtime.txt file under the root of the repo and put 3.7(Netlify supports either 3.7 or 3.5) in it. Alright, now that the Pelican is ready, I can move on to set the Netlify up! Connect to Netlify This part is actually quite easy. I registered to Netlify‘s free tier, and followed this step-to-step guide to connect my GitHub repo. The only thing different is on ‘ Step 4: Configure Your Settings' . Since I was using Pelican, the ‘Build command' I used is: pelican content - s publishconf . py After some failed builds due to dependencies issues, I got everything to work. Netlify automatically pulled my GitHub repo, installed the dependencies and built the site. I applied a custom domain with Google Domains and followed this link to set it up: https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/#googledomains . With $12 a year, it's totally worth it. I also turned on SSL , following this guide. So now my site is up and running on its new home: My blog with ‘Elegant' theme The Thoughts The whole migration process took me around one day. I learned quite some new stuff from it. It's challenging but totally do-able. I encourage anyone that's interested in treating your blogging seriously to try this out. It's quite neat. Some people say data scientists should focus on their research and learning, I tend to wander off from time to time. Picking up some web programming tips here, getting some DevOps experience there. I found this kind of ‘digress' actually is a bit relaxing and stimulate the other part of my brain. It's a form of rest and relax. I felt like playing a hacking game and solving problems along the way. Having knowledge of deployment will help you in putting your model to production easier and quicker. Having a blog is like having another venue to communicate with your colleagues and like-minded people out there. Can't go wrong with that, right? Any feedback or constructive criticism are welcomed.

In this video, Atlas from Boston Dynamics was performing a whole set of gymnastics routine including jumping, rolling and jump forward, stand up-side-down with two arms, and finally a 180 vertical spin. Again, amazing yet scary at the same time. The moves are so human-like is somewhat passed the uncanny valley and starts to appear very natural. With the fluent flow of moves showcased in this very short video, people can't help but ask: how are we till we see some KungFu master level robot moves? Like what we see in Alita: Battle Angel ? I can think of one thing this could be useful for. As far as I know, a lot of ancient Kung Fu set were lost in history just because there are no good apprentices to learn and preserve it. Huge lost for humanity IMO . If we can develop a robot that can ‘copy' the set moves, at least we can preserve at least the form of it, right?","tags":"Machine Learning","url":"how-long-until-boston-dynamics-robot-can-be-a-kungfu-master.html"},{"title":"Two Sides of the Same Coin: Jeremy Howard's fast.ai vs Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai","text":"How Not to ‘Overfit' Your AI Learning by Taking Both fast.ai and deeplearning.ai courses Which One to Take? WHY NOT BOTH ! Data science and artificial intelligence might be the hottest topic in tech right now, and rightfully so. There are tremendous breakthroughs both on application level and research fields. This is a blessing, and a curse, at least for students and enthusiasts that want to break into this area. There are too many algorithms to learn, too many coding/engineering skills to hone, and way too many new papers to keep up with even if you felt you've mastered the art. The journey is long, the learning curve is steep, the strife is real, yet the potential is so great people still flock into it. The good thing is we also have great educators and instructors working on mitigating the pain and make the process a little less harsh and a bit more fun. We'll explore two of the greatest among them and share a potentially effective approach to help you swim through the sea of Data Science a bit happier. AI Learning ‘Burn-out' Photo by Toa Heftiba on Unsplash If you list what one needs to learn to become an ‘ OK ' data scientist or machine learning engineer, it could be scarily long: Math: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, Algorithms, … Coding: Python, R, SQL /NoSQL, Hadoop, Spark, Tensorflow/PyTorch, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, OpenCV, Data Visualization… Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, PCA , Anomaly Detection, Collaborative Filtering, Neural Network, CNN , RNN , K-Means, NLP , Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, AutoML, … Engineering: Command Line, Cloud platform( AWS , GCP , Asure), DevOps, Deployment, NGINX /Apache, Docker… The list can easily make the head spin for a person just entering the filed. Yet, it is still just scratching the surface. Some people make an ambitious plan ( Siraj Raval 's plan is great btw) and dive right into it. Some lost momentum and felt totally under the water and the exit is nowhere to be seen. What went wrong? You ‘Overfit' Yourself From Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course Overfitting is a very familiar idea for anyone that knows a bit of Machine Learning. It basically means your algorithm learned ‘too much' of the data and buried itself into the little details of the data-set and missing the big picture. Come to think of it, sometimes when we learn something, we dive so deep we forgot why we were learning it and how it will fit into the big picture. It's something I'd like to call ‘overfitting' your own learning. This happens especially often for people coming from academia background. A math Ph.D. tends to make sure all the theorems are fully understood before proceeding to the next one. This is great for learning math. Have a profound understanding of theories will give you great intuition and confidence. It will enable you to see patterns and issues people without the training cannot see easily, yet Data Science demands more. Theory aside, there is also a practical part to it. A properly applied algorithm coupled with efficient codes, carefully tuned hyper-parameters, and well-designed pipeline will usually achieve decent results, but not algorithm alone. Delve down too deep into theory, and you risk missing the practical side of the learning. It's equally important to accumulate experiences on how to implement what you learned and handle real-life complexities. How to address this? Entering deeplearning.ai and fast.ai courses. Deeplearning.ai and Fast.ai A lot of courses have been developed to help navigate people through the learning process. Among them, Deeplearning.ai and fast.ai are two unique ones that have their own approaches and can give us some insights into a potentially effective way of learning Data Science. deeplearning.ai deeplearning.ai is a paid course developed by Andrew Ng . Like his other courses , it is known for its well-designed learning curve, calm and smooth teaching style, and challenging while fun assignments. It is well accepted as the Deep Learning course one cannot go wrong with. It starts from the fundamental theories and works its way up on how to put all the pieces together to solve real-life problems. It's also called a ‘Bottom-up' approach. fast.ai fast.ai is introduced by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas as a free course to teach people with basic coding experience state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Without much explanation of the underlying theories, with very few lines of code, student of fast.ai is capable of achieving astoundingly great results on its own domain quickly into the lessons. (I built a Chinese Calligraphy Style Classifier that reaches 96% accuracy rate and deployed it on the cloud after finishing lesson 1 of fast.ai course.) It teaches you how to tackle the real-world problem first, then digs deeper and deeper into how and why things work. It's also called a ‘Top-down' approach. Which One is the Best Approach? Both! So ‘Bottom-up' and ‘Top-down', which one is better? Which one should we take? The answer is Both ! Photo by Maarten Deckers on Unsplash See, these two courses complement each other. Say you start from Andrew Ng 's deeplearning.ai course, you buried yourself into endless formulas and theories, you gained a lot of intuition, but after weeks of learning, you still have nothing to show to your friends and not quite sure when you can apply your newly gained knowledge. Your study on the machine learning fundamentals is getting diminishing returns. Your brain slows down and you start to feel boring. Now is the perfect time to start taking a lesson or two of the fast.ai course. With the help of the powerful fast.ai library and few lines of code, you'll be able to build impressive models that solve real-life problems and even beat some state-of-the-art papers and Kaggle competitions. This will give your brain a totally different kind of stimulation and your heart more confidence and passion to delve deeper into why everything works. Once you built a couple of projects and ‘wow'ed your friends, you will be more motivated to learn more about the fundamentals, then you can go back to deeplearning.ai course and keep your study there. These two courses push each other forward, you can just rinse and repeat till you finished both. This forms a perfect learning circle. Photo by Dan Freeman on Unsplash The best thing about taking both courses this way is once you finished both, you'll be fully prepared. You have tons of projects built along the way from fast.ai course to showcase to potential employers and you also have the deep knowledge of how everything works or even published one paper or two to show your findings. You are now a well-rounded Data Scientist. How cool is that?","tags":"Machine Learning","url":"two-sides-of-the-same-coin.html"},{"title":"How to Deploy Your Machine Learning Web App to Digital Ocean","text":"Using Fast.ai, Docker, GitHub, and Starlette ASGI Framework You've collected your data, cleaned it up diligently, squeezed it into your carefully fine-tuned model and sweated many GPU hours and trained the model. The prediction is State-Of-The-Art! Bravo! But what now? Share it with the world of course! It has such great potential and no one has done this before, you want everyone to try it out! How? You ask. In this tutorial, I'll introduce you to an affordable and flexible way of deploying your trained Machine Learning model. I'll walk you through every step in the way and hopefully, after reading this article, you'll have no issue deploying your ‘next big thing(model)' to the world. How to Train(and export) Your Dragon(Model) Image from https://www.facebook.com/HowToTrainYourDragon/ First of all, you need to train your model and export it. In this article, we'll use Fast.ai's library to showcase how it's done. You may want to refer to my two-part articles about how to collect data and train a Chinese Calligraphy Classifier model or you can also use your own model. For the purpose of this article, I'll assume that you already trained the model and achieved your desired accuracy rate. Fast.ai uses a learn object to train the model, to export your model, use methodlearn.export() to export and save your trained model to a export.pkl file( my model export file from the link above is around 100MB ). Save this file, we'll use that later. ‘GitHub-Driven' Web Development With the model ready, the next step is web app development. I assume you are a full-stack web developer, so let's jump right into coding. No, I'm just kidding here. We'll use a boilerplate web app template on GitHub to quickly get your web app ready. You only need to do some minor tweaks and you'll be ready to go. If you don't know what GitHub is, it is a place to hold the source code of a lot of open-source applications. I already put a ready-made web app's code there so you can easily download and reuse. Go to this GitHub repository , click the big green button ‘ Clone or download ' on the right side, like below: On the pop-down window, copy the link, then go to your terminal and type: git clone [ https : // github . com / wayofnumbers / fastai - vision - uvicorn - gunicorn - starlette - docker . git ]( https : // github . com / wayofnumbers / fastai - vision - uvicorn - gunicorn - starlette - docker . git ) cd fastai - vision - uvicorn - gunicorn - starlette - docker These commands will clone all the required code onto your local machine, under a folder named fastai-vision-uvicorn-gunicorn-starlette-docker and enter that folder. This is the main folder we'll be working on, there are a couple of things in it that worth explaining: app : The structure of this appfolder is as below: template | --app.html main . py export . pkl This is where your Starlette web app source code resides. It has a very simple Python file main.py. The **Starlette **is a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high-performance asyncio services. It also has the saved model fileexport.pkl. The template folder holds an HTML template file app.html which will serve as your web app UI . Remember the exported export.pkl file you saved? Pull that out and replace the one in this app folder. So the app will use your model. You are also welcomed to update the app.html file for better-looking UI , but it's not necessary as far as deployment is concerned. Now the source code of your web app is ready, we need to wrap it into a Docker container and do some testing. We use the Dockerfile as the config file. We'll explore more in the next section. Let's Dockerize it! We will use Docker to create a container where our web app runs. If you don't know what Docker is, just know that it is kind of a mini virtual machine, with all the necessary libraries and dependencies installed so the app can run smoothly. It is smaller and more flexible than real Virtual Machine and can be created and deployed very easily. First, you need to install Docker. Here is a very thorough guide for your reference. After installation, if you are running Ubuntu, then it's beneficial to run the following commands: sudo groupadd docker sudo usermod - aG docker $ USER This will eliminate the need to use sudoevery time you enter a docker command. Reboot, now docker should be properly installed. In the same directory where app folder and Dockerfile resides, we need to create a docker image that contains all source code within this folder so we can test things out. Enter the following command(don't forget the ‘.' at the end): docker build - t test_app . This will start a docker image building process according to the Dockerfile. It will take a while, so let's take a brief look at what's inside the Dockerfile: # 1 FROM tiangolo / uvicorn - gunicorn - starlette : python3 . 7 # 2 RUN pip install fastai aiohttp # 3 RUN pip install jinja2 # 4 RUN pip install starlette # 5 COPY . / app / app # 6 WORKDIR / app # 7 EXPOSE 80 It is quite self-explanatory: Line 1: Specify from which starter image we'll build our docker image. We use tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-starlette:python3.7 . You can find its GitHub link here and Docker Hub link here . Line 2,3,4: Install fast.ai library, jinja template framework, Starlette framework, and other utilities. Line 5: Copy your app folder into docker image so our app can run within the docker container. Line 6, 7: Assign work directory to the app folder and expose port 80 to outside so we can visit the web app through port 80( HTTP ). Once the docker image is created, run docker images to check. You'll find something like: REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE test_app latest xxxxxxxxx 1 minutes ago 4 . 05 GB Now we can fire up a docker container from the created image and test your app locally: docker run - p 80 : 80 \\ - v . / absolute / path / to / export . pkl : / app / export . pkl \\ - e TITLE = \"Chinese Calligraphy Classifier\" \\ - e SUBTITLE = \"Can disambiguate Chinese calligraphy styles like KaiShu, LiShu, XiaoZhuan\" test_app On the above docker command, we specified the port to be 80. We transferred two environment variables into the container, TITLE and SUBTITLE , they will be used to display our web app UI titles. At the end we specified our docker image name: test_app. Please note that for export.pkl file, you need to use the absolute path, otherwise Docker will not be able to find it. If you don't see any error, your docker container should now be up and running. Head over to your browser and type 127.0.0.1 and hit enter, voilà ! You should see the web app. Give it a ‘Kaishu', ‘Lishu' or ‘Xiaozhuan' calligraphy image and hit ‘ Classify ', you should see something like this: Very rough web app UI You can see the app classified this as ‘KaiShu', which is correct. Now that your app is up and running on the local machine, we are 80% done. What's left is to deploy it on the cloud. Let's head to the cloud next! Next Step, Cloud! For the cloud hosting service, we'll use DigitalOcean . Comparing to the more incumbent players like Amazon AWS , GCP , or Azure, it's more friendly to developers and cheaper. You can follow this well written and concise tutorial to create an account and a ‘Droplet' of your own. (‘Droplet' is a virtual machine running by Digital Ocean where you can install your app in, much like an AWS instance.) If you want, you can use this link to create your account and get $50 credit for free, which will be enough to get you started. Use the following configuration as a reference: It is recommended that you create your Droplets with at least 4G memory since installing PyTorch will require a lot of memory. You can resize it down to 2G later. You can choose the default ‘Data Center' and set up your authentication method. Use SSH key or password, whichever way you feel more comfortable. I personally prefer SSH key, fewer keypresses and more secure. Once the Droplet is created, SSH into it and we are ready for the final deployment! Deploy! Deploy! Deploy！ Now you should be able to SSH into your server as root. It's recommended to create a normal user with sudo privilege, you can follow this tutorial . Once a normal user is created, log out of your root user and SSH back into the server with your normal user account. The final deployment is very similar to what we've already done on our local machine, only this time we do it on the remote droplet server. First, let's git clone our repo so we have the source code: git clone [ https : // github . com / wayofnumbers / fastai - vision - uvicorn - gunicorn - starlette - docker . git ]( https : // github . com / wayofnumbers / fastai - vision - uvicorn - gunicorn - starlette - docker . git ) cd fastai - vision - uvicorn - gunicorn - starlette - docker Don't forget to copy your export.pkl file to replace what's in the app folder. (follow this link if you don't know how) If docker is not installed, install docker. Then build the docker image using below command. Again, if the image building failed due to low memory, resize your memory up, you can resize it down later without much cost increase. docker build - t test_app . Once the image is built, fire up the docker container: docker run - p 80 : 80 \\ - v . / absolute / path / to / export . pkl : / app / export . pkl \\ - e TITLE = \"Chinese Calligraphy Classifier\" \\ - e SUBTITLE = \"Can disambiguate Chinese calligraphy styles like KaiShu, LiShu, XiaoZhuan\" test_app Once the docker container is up and running, head over to your browser and enter your Droplet's IP address, hit Enter. Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your Deep Learning model to the Internet! Conclusion Not that hard, huh? Deployment using standard DigitalOcean Droplet offers a lot of flexibilities. You can do whatever you want to your Droplets since you have root access. You can run multiple apps on it, and pay very little($5 - $10 tier should be enough). If your app gets some traction and needs more resources, you can easily scale up. I hope this tutorial somewhat help you deploy your AI app. If you have any question or want to share your deployment experience, please write a response below. Happy Deploying!","tags":"Machine Learning","url":"how-to-deploy-ML-web-app-to-DO.html"},{"title":"OpenAI: Catch Me If You Can","text":"What OpenAI's Multi-Agent Hide and Seek Break Through Means Who is OpenAI? When it comes to reinforcement learning, OpenAI is a big name. The OpenAI Gym toolkit provides a solid foundation for a lot of ML researchers to explore and study reinforcement learning techniques. They also are known to have developed ‘ GPT -2 ' language model. The ‘deep fake' news the model generated is so scarily good that OpenAI refused to release the trained model, just the code and paper . From OpenAI.com Hide and Seek, Only This Time the Computer is Playing It Today they release something new and equally groundbreaking: The Multi-agent Hide and Seek . You can have a look at the short video below from their website: Simply put, they designed a reinforcement agent and let it play a simple ‘Hide and Seek' game that we all played when we were still a kid. After millions of games played with itself and the prior version of itself. Both the seeking and hiding agent developed several very effective strategies to counter each other and win. Basic abilities agent has to play and win the game How to Train Your Dragon, urr… Agent The agents develop their tactics in an adversarial way. Both agents move randomly Seeking agent learns to chase hiding agent. Hiding agent learns to run away from seeking agent (not working) Hiding agent learns to use blocks in the environment to block entrance to a small room and hide inside (It works!) Seeking agent learns to use ramp blocks in the environment to jump over the wall to get inside the blocked room Hiding agent learns to move ramp blocks inside the room, then block the room …… the game keeps playing and more gaming mechanism is discovered and exploited, both agents getting smarter and smarter. The seeking agent and hiding agent counter each other and at the same time grow with each other. This is a concept (相生相克 mutually reinforce and neutralize each other) very familiar to Chinese people, and can be illustrated in a simple way: Taichi 太极 Philosophy aside, we did see this kind of concept appear on recent AI field quite often. Another example is the rise of GAN (General Adversarial Network) where a ‘generator' and ‘discriminator' are trained at the same time to achieve state-of-the-art results. The Agents Looks Cute! But Why I Still Feels a Bit Chilly on My Spine? Agents in the game are quite cute with cartoony big heads and smiley eyes. But underneath the cuteness, what does the great results suggest? Well, just imagine, if they are not playing this cute little hide and seek game where agents giggles when get caught, rather, they are playing Doom or Quake, where blood and gores fly around when the agent gets caught. Will the bloody scene lead you to start worrying about the possible application of this model and the potential it has if weaponized? If this still seems too far away from reality, let me bring this uncomfortable imagination one step further, allow me to use three words: Boston Dynamic, Drones, Skynet. The tasks and tactics agent learned from millions of games might still seem easy. Hide, use blocks, use ramps, etc. But don't forget that complicated and sophisticated strategy is formed with all these small pieces. One big advancement of AI recently is transfer learning , build new AI models on top of already trained/learned models. (Using transfer learning based on already trained IMAGENET model, people can quickly train a fine-grained cat/dog classifier with only 100 images and 1 GPU in minutes. I explained the approach of fast.ai at here ). These basic game tactic model can be utilized in the future to build more realistic and dangerous military strategy models that can totally be applied in war. This is not beyond our reach now. If we put all our current AI and robotic achievements together, great/scary things can be achieved. When an OpenAI model agent running within a Boston Dynamics robot or killer drones, and video surveillance networks everywhere to watch your every step, if you are the hider playing this game, what is the chance of you winning?","tags":"Machine Learning","url":"openai-catch-me-if-you-can.html"},{"title":"How I Trained Computer to Learn Calligraphy Styles: Part 2","text":"Build a Deep Learning Model with fast.ai Library Photo by Kon Karampelas on Unsplash I wanted to start a series of posts for the projects I finished/polished for my Practical Deep Learning for Coders fast.ai course. Since I'm pretty green on ML / DL field, I hope the challenges I faced and overcome could be of value for other people experiencing the same journey. Model 1 ・ 1a Making It Even Better In my last post , I explained the approach I take for this image recognition problem using fast.ai library. As you can see, once we get the data down to a fast.ai ImageDataBunch, the code is rather simple and we achieve a 90% accuracy rate, which is quite impressive considering the quality of our data(randomly downloaded from Google/Baidu search without much data cleaning). Now, can we do better? DDI Editor's Pick: 5 Machine Learning Books That Turn You from Novice to Expert | Data Driven… The booming growth in the Machine Learning industry has brought renewed interest in people about Artificial… www.datadriveninvestor.com Turns out, we can! How? Well, there are two things in our prior pipeline that could improve: Image Pre-processing Tweak Model Training Fine Tune. Let's dive deeper. Image Pre-Processing Tweak Remember when we import our data into fast.ai ImageDataBunch, we used the following code: Notice that on our image pre-processing, i.e. get_transforms function, we didn't give it any parameter and just used the default. The default will try to apply a variety of image augmentation techniques to make the image data-set generalize better, like flipping, warping, rotating, cropping, etc. This is good, fast.ai library helped us do the ‘best practice' for the majority of the cases. But in our case here, some default might not work that well. The biggest one is ‘flipping'. Because we are trying to classify calligraphy artworks and in real life, it will never randomly flip left/right or up/down. So making the images flips randomly will not reflect the real-life cases and thus won't help with our training accuracy. To fix this, we tweaked our code as below: Notice we pass do_flip=False into the get_transforms function, thus telling the module to not randomly flipping our images during importing. Model Training Fine Tune Now that the image pre-processing is done. We can re-structure out model training to avoid overfitting and achieve better accuracy. This approach is introduced in the fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders course lesson 3 . Instead of training the model directly from a 256x256 image size, we'll gradually scaling up the image size. More concretely, we will first train a CNN to classify the images of 128x128 size, once we achieved best accuracy, we'll then use transfer learning and keep training the model on the same data-set, except with 256x256 image size. We'll call the 128x128 image size training ‘stage 1' and 256x256 image size training ‘stage 2' After our stage 1 training(where my last post left off), we have a trained CNN model called learn , it's ‘unfreezed' and achieves an accuracy of around 85%. Accuracy 86% after training a 128x128 image size CNN . Now we need to freeze the network again, create a new ImageDataBunch with 256x256 image size and restart the same training process. After finding the best learning rate, we train the CNN with another 2 epochs, already breaking into 91% accuracy. We'll then do the same ‘unfreeze' and keep training. After unfreeze, we trained the model with another 4 epochs, the accuracy broke into 96.5% . Observed that valudation_losshas already surpassed training_loss, suggesting a sign of overfitting. We'll stop our training here. This simple technique is also called ‘ Progressive resizing ' by Jeremy Howard from fast.ai and helped his team beat Google in a competition of speed training IMAGENET in *DAWNBench by training the IMAGGNET in a whopping 18 minutes and \\$40 Amazon AWS cost.* To Wrap It Up Photo by Franki Chamaki on Unsplash With two simple tweaks, we managed to increase the accuracy around 6.5%, breaking into the state-of-the-art range of results. Major takeaways: When doing image pre-processing, make sure the processed images still properly represent what real-life data will look like. The reason gradually increase training image size works is: by giving the trained model a data-set that's 4 times bigger, actually means giving the model a brand new data to train, avoiding overfitting. Starting from smaller sized images for training will also have the benefit of faster training and quicker experimenting. This usually leads to better results. That's it for Chinese Calligraphy Classifier. I hope you learned a thing or two after reading these two articles. We're trying to get some specific calligrapher's ‘true' and ‘fake' artworks and see if we can build a ‘true or false' classifier. This will be a very interesting and much valuable next step. Will report back and write more articles if we made real progress. But until then, we'll move on to put this well-trained model into production and build a web-app around it. Stay tuned.

Since I'm pretty green on ML / DL field, I hope the challenges I faced and overcome could be of value for other people experiencing the same journey. Model 1 ・ 1a Why Build a Chinese Calligraphy Classifier Like any calligraphy, Chinese calligraphy is a form of art. Some great pieces written by some ancient masters have both great art value and economic values (selling at multi-million dollars on auctions). * Jieshi Tie by Song Dynasty politician and scholar Zeng Gong, \\$30,000,000* There are multiple main styles/schools of calligraphy, mainly belongs to different dynasties. Each has its own way of shaping the character and arranging them. The differences are subtle and abstract. It makes sense to see if a trained deep learning model can do a good job of telling which style it is. DDI Editor's Pick: 5 Machine Learning Books That Turn You from Novice to Expert | Data Driven… The booming growth in the Machine Learning industry has brought renewed interest in people about Artificial… www.datadriveninvestor.com I picked three styles: Lishu(隶书) Kaishu(楷书) Xiaozhuan(小篆) as a proof-of-concept. Once successful trained, the model could serve as a transfer learning base-model for the more fine-grained classifier( e.g. calligraphers classifier). This has some real-life value. From time to time, some ancient artifacts are discovered and some of them are calligraphy artworks. Sometimes it's hard to tell whose work it is. Is it valuable (like undiscovered artwork by a famous calligrapher)? This calligrapher classifier can serve as a way to quickly identify artworks by great calligraphers. ( Finding diamond in the rough 😉 ) Collecting Data To build a calligraphy classifier, we will need some calligraphy examples of each style. I did some search online and cannot find any good already-made data-set for different calligraphy styles. So I'll have to build it myself. Building a images data-set isn't hard thanks to Google's Images search functionality and some JavaScript snippets. Here's how: Go to Google Images and search for \"隶书 字帖 网格\" (lishu, characters book, grid), this will give you the most relevant results. Scroll down to show more results, you'll hit the bottom with ‘ Show more results ' button. Click if you want more, but keep in mind that 700 images is the maximum here. Google search results for Lishu style Now is where the magic happens. Press Ctrl+Shift+J in Windows/Linux and Cmd+Opt+J in Mac to bring up the JavaScript ‘Console' window of the browser. The following JavaScript snippet will get the URLs of each of the images. 4) If successfully run, a text file will be downloaded with all the URLs for the images in your search results. You can then set up a folder and use fast.ai's ‘download_images' function to download these images. Rinse and repeat for other styles. You might want to put them into different folders like kaishu, xiaozhuan and put them all under a folder called train so later on, fast.ai can easily import them into the model. Alternatively, you can also go to Baidu.com for images search, using this snippet to automatically download the images you searched for. (Code too long to be put into this post, so I link it here). Let's Have a Look at the Data If you organize the downloaded images into train/lishu, train/kaishu, train/xiaozhuan, then you can run the following code to import them into and transformed accordingly, ready to fit a model.fast.ai's powerfulImageDataBunch object, where all data is organized, splitted and transformed accordingly, ready to fit a model. Note that we split the train/validation set with an 80/20 ratio, image resized to 224 which is a good default for any image recognition task. Now that data is imported properly, let's look at our images: As we can see from the few examples above, the data-set is rather ‘dirty'. The images are not properly cropped, with some side notes with different calligraphy style and some images only have one or two characters. But it's OK . Let's quickly train the model and see how it performs so we can gain some insights into our data. Quick and Dirty Training Let's first create a model. We'll be using transfer learning and use ResNet50 as our model. Pre-trained weights will be downloaded. With 3 epoches of fit_one_cycle, we managed to reach a 90% accuracy rate on our validation set. Not bad! Unfreeze and Fine-Tune Our Training Since the fit_one_cycle function will freeze the initial layers and only training the last couple of layers to speed up the training speed(this approach works because usually for transfer learning, initial layers will capture basic features of the images that are not likely to change a lot), we can hopefully further improve our accuracy by unfreezing all the layers and train again. We used the above lr_find function to find a good learning rate range. The key is to find the steepest slope (as indicated in the orange circle above) in the learning curve and slice it for further training. For example, in the above figure, the bottom of the curve is at 1e-03, then we can pick one point at 1/10 of that, which is 1e-04, and the other one at 1e-06 or 1e-05 (This is inspired from an experimental concept of ‘Super-convergence', described in details in fast.ai course . Sometime you need to do a bit of experiment to find the best learning rate combination but then again, fast.ai is always preaching iterative and interactive approach.) The idea is still to train the first couple of layers slower and last couple layers faster. Let's train another two epoch: Slightly better and the validation_loss starts to surpass train_loss, a sign of overfitting. Let's stop here and wrap things up. Results Interpretation We reached 90% accuracy. Not state-of-the-art but already pretty impressive considering we only have a roughly 700 images per class data-set. More data will definitely lead to better results. Let's look at our results and see if we can find some insights. Using the ClassificationIntepretation object from fast.ai, we can easily calculate the top_losses and see what they are: Look at the confusion matrix, the model does really well in recognize ‘xiaozhuan', probably due to its unique stroke arrangements. A couple of insights: We still have totally wrong images like the grid one (2nd one on 1st row) If there are too few (1st row, 1st column) or too many (2nd row, 2nd column) characters, the model will struggle. Some image shows ‘in-between' kind of styles which the model also had a hard time classify. Which is totally normal, since even human will have a hard time telling which style it belongs to. Final Thoughts This experimental project actually works exceedingly well with fast.ai library. Jeremy Howard said on the course and I quote here (not exactly word by word, but I hope I captured the gist of it. 🙏): fast.ai is a very opinionated library. Wherever we know a best default, we'll choose it for you. Whatever best practice we know works well, we'll do it for you. This is at least proven in this project. With only very few lines of code and very minimum efforts for data collection, we managed a 90% accurate model. I believe with more and better quality data. The state-of-the-art results could be achieved and our calligrapher classifier vision is not beyond reach. fast.ai's tagline: Making neural nets uncool again. Finally, allow me to paraphrase above tagline with a Chinese poet: \"Where once the swallows knew the mansions of the great, They now to humbler homes would fly to nest and mate.\" You could find out how I fine-tuned the model and achieved better accuracy at the link below: How I Trained Computer to Learn Calligraphy Styles: Part 2 Build a Deep Learning Models with fast.ai Library medium.com","tags":"Machine Learning","url":"chinese-calligraphy-classifier-1.html"},{"title":"I finished Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course and I Felt Great!","text":"The good, the bad, and the beautiful Just finished Andrew Ng 's Machine Learning course on Coursera , and it's GREAT !

Not assuming the student have any prior knowledge and gradually guide them through complex concept makes the learning experience challenging yet still fun. Avoid complex math, yet find a way to still enable student to do ML (meme) The Andrew Ng ‘Silent Protector' Meme Maybe the biggest fear for people want to get into Machine Learning and AI is ‘I'm not a math person'. Being able to not getting into too much math yet still explain clearly the concept is invaluable, especially for totally green guys. *Octave / Matlab is more ‘math' like, less digression on programming language itself* Some people might not agree with me on this. Yes Octave/Matlab doesn't have all the fancy libraries like scikit-learn and Pandas, yet it's very expressive when it comes to represent math equations. Transfer equations from class to Matlab code is easier than Python IMHO . Cover most popular models, good foundation Linear/Logistic Regression SVM Neural Network Collaborative Filtering Anomaly Detection K-Means PCA With all these algorithms/models under your belt, you are ready to solve a lot of problems with Machine Learning. Provide practical ML projects knowledge, not only algorithm and programming Besides theory, the course also offers very practical Machine Learning project knowledge, hot to build a pipeline, how to structure the problem solving, etc. Well designed quizzes and assignments, as part of learning too I was always amazed by how well the quizzes and assignments are designed. They are challenging, yet with some efforts achievable, and at the same time offer some new perspective on the lesson. I always learned a few new things doing those and totally enjoyed them. What's lacking? A bit dated on libraries and architectures You won't find the high-level Keras , TensorFlow or PyTorth here, but this course is about foundation of Machine Learning and it delivered on its promise. 2. Could use more examples/applications of ML for motivation There are a lot of exciting development and applications on ML / AI field. If students could be exposed to more of those, it will give them more reasons to keep learning.

Pelican Themes also offer some previews of them so you can have a good idea of what to expect. Some themes are really easy to setup and configure, others need some efforts. The Elegant them is the latter. For most of the themes, to make it work, you just need to add define the ‘ THEME ' variable, like so: 'THEME' = 'theme/themename' For Elegant, it's way more than that, and it's a good thing. Elegant packed a lot of great features and thorough considerations to the reader. And that's why I choose it as the theme for my site. Good things come with a price they say. So let's find out. Search Search is useful when you have a lot of articles. All serious blog need to have it. To use it, add ‘tipue_search' and ‘sitemap' to your plugins and it will automatically be enabled. About Me and My Project Elegant's home page layout put the blogger himself front and center with ‘About Me' and the ‘My Project' at the top, followed with ‘Recent Posts'. To use them, you need to set the ‘LANDING_PAGE_ABOUT' and ‘ PROJECTS ' variables in the pelicanconf.py . jQuery Issue I've enabled all the nice features, like search, collasible comments, collasible comments. But they all won't work on Chrome because it's considered ‘unsafe scripts'. After some digging, it turns out the site is using HTTPS , while the original theme's template uses HTTP to load the jQuery that did all these nice features. Once I replaced the HTTP with its HTTPS counterpart, everything works like a charm. Table of Contents Took me some time to get table of contents to work. Firstly ‘extract_toc' plugin needs to be added into the ‘ PLUGINS ' variable. Then ‘markdown' Python module needs to be installed and configured for it to work as the Elegant website instructions. But after all this, it still didn't work. Turns out, you need to add [TOC] in the Markdown file, after all the meta data, to actually add the table of contents into your post. After I did that, everything works. Conclusion Install and tweaking a Pelican theme isn't that hard. Look into the static folder for CSS , tweak them if you want, or add custom CSS of your own and load them in the template. Then go into the template folder to check the html files. With basic HTML / CSS /Javascripts knowledge, you already can achieve a lot on tweaking any theme of your liking.","tags":"Tools","url":"Tweak-Pelican-Elegant-Theme.html"},{"title":"The AI Shortage","text":"Original Story Nikolai Yakovenko from NVIDIA : But when I look for a designer, a Java developer, a real estate agent, etc — some are way better than others and deserve to get paid more than an AI researcher — but you're fundamentally talking about pulling from a large well-balanced pool.

It drives money into investing on the next big thing, and the money lures more talents into the field. There will be a shortage in the very beginning, and there will always be a surplus at the end of the curve. I'm afraid AI won't be any different.

Overview 1.1 Dataset Selection When it comes to text data analysis practice, solid and relevant content makes it easier to figure out hidden paterns and insights. Also by picking an area where domain knowledge is strong, it makes the data analysis process less boring and more meaningful. That's why TechCrunch posts compilation is a good dataset to start. TechCrunch is known to be always up-to-date, covering new technology and rising startups 24/7, and the content is also familiar. Unlike pure text file datasets, this dataset is organized into cvs format. Besides the posts content texts, other interesting and valuable features are also included: post date, authors, category, tags, title and image source. With the abundance of features, the potential insights are quite impressive. 1.2 Potential Analysis of Dataset By analyzing the length of the posts, we can gain an idea of typical technical blog length, combined with the post date data, we can then figure out whether the technical blogging world is going towards a more lengthy way or prefer shorter, bite-sized writeups. This will provide good guidance for new bloggers or big news corporations on how long they should control their post lengths. Further, since the posts have category feature, it's possible for us to do comparison on the average post length across different topics. Giving us more insights into the post length trend per topics. We can also calculate the frequencies of words used in the posts, look at the most popular words in certain categories, this will help the writers to check if some new ‘buzz words' are worth noticing and add to his dictionary. Combined with the post dates, valuable information about the rise or fall of certain words can be extracted from the data set, providing some interesting insights. For example, by comparing the frequencies of ‘iOS' and ‘Android' in ‘apps' category posts, we can know which faction is gaining more traction in the mobile app war. We can use the tf-idf method to figure out the most unique words for each category, and develop a tags recommendation system based on our learning. Then with ‘tags' and ‘title' features, we can then develop an algorithm to predict possible tags, and train our algorithm with the tags and title data. Last but not least, the ‘image source' data can tell us which category uses more images than others. By parsing and analyzing the image url data, we can figure out what's the most popular image upload/share service, and with ‘post date' data, the trend of these services. 1.3 Business Applications This project is able to help bloggers, technical writers, website editors to track and find out the most popular words in different areas like ‘apps', ‘startups'. They can use the finding to enrich their vocabulary and gain better success in the future writing. The data visualization, especiall the word cloud can help the marketing managers and analyst find out the new ‘buzz word' of the month, thus help spotting potential new opportunity. By looking at the ‘startups' category, it can help the VC to spotting new interesting starups if its name rises in word frequency. With a little tweak of the data selection, for example if we classify the articles using ‘author' instead of ‘category', we can gain insights into one certain writer's vocabulary, and give suggestions on whether he has beening using one phrase a bit too much and also sugget new ‘hot word of the month' to him, thus creating some value or SAAS he/she might willing to pay for monthly.

Data Import First we need to import all the Python modules we will need for this assignment: In [1]: import sklearn import seaborn as ans import plotly import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd import numpy as np % matplotlib inline Pandas can handle most of the dataset formats, JSON , csv, HTML , text, Excel, SQL etc. Here is a complete list . In [2]: %%time # using Pandas' 'read_csv‘ methos to read the source dataset csv into a DataFrame object # for further processing, there are other ways to read big csv file for Python that's faster # like pandas.io.parsers.read_csv, but since our dataset is not too big, we'll just use # pandas.read_csv in this assignment df = pd . read_csv ( './techcrunch_posts.csv' ) print ( df . shape ) # We are dealing with a dataset that has 39115 entries and 11 columns. (39115, 11) CPU times: user 1.02 s, sys: 107 ms, total: 1.12 s Wall time: 1.12 s We added the Jupyter Notebook magic command ‘%%time' to calculate time consumption of the read in process. As we can see 2s isn't too bad. In [5]: #Printing categories available. categories = { x for x in df [ 'category' ] if x == x } print ( 'There are %d categories in the dataset.' % ( len ( categories ))) There are 55 categories in the dataset. Since we want to predict the correct category for an article, we want to group our data into categories and do analysis on each category to gain insights. In [6]: # only put content texts with 'Apps' category into a list of texts raw_apps = [] for index , row in df . iterrows (): if row [ 'category' ] == 'Apps' : raw_apps . append ( row [ 'content' ]) #find out how many articles in app category and display one article to see how it looks like. print ( 'There are %d articles in catetory: Apps \\n ' % ( len ( raw_apps ))) There are 9395 articles in catetory: Apps We have 9395 posts that's in the category of ‘apps'. We can see from above results that the raw_apps is a string of list containing all the content texts. In [7]: # put all raw content texts into a list of texts raw_content = [] for index , row in df . iterrows (): raw_content . append ( row [ 'content' ]) print ( len ( raw_content )) 39115 In [8]: # only put content texts with 'Startups' category into a list of texts raw_startups = [] for index , row in df . iterrows (): if row [ 'category' ] == 'Startups' : raw_startups . append ( row [ 'content' ]) print ( len ( raw_startups )) 2969 In [9]: # Print the number of entries for the selected categories d = [ len ( raw_startups ), len ( raw_apps )] index = [ 'Startups:' , 'Apps:' ] cat_len = pd . Series ( d , index ) cat_len . head () Out[9]: Startups: 2969 Apps: 9395 dtype: int64 Now that we've read in the data, put into Pandas DataFrame so it's easier to manipulate. Then we look at the articles in groups, read some single article etc. After some data exploration, we have a rough idea of what the dataset is and how it is organized. Let's find out what we can do with it next. BACK TO TOP 3. Data Preprocessing Now that we imported and data and gained some initial understanding of the dataset, we will be moving on to do some preprocessing 3.1 Data Subset Cleanup First of all, we will reduce the dataset size a little. In [10]: # shorten the list for better processing speed dataset = raw_apps [: 3000 ] print ( 'The length of the data set now is: %d \\n ' % ( len ( dataset ))) The length of the data set now is: 3000 In [11]: # put the list of all strings into pandas DataFrame for furthur processing. dfContent = pd . DataFrame ( dataset , columns = [ 'Content' ]) print ( dfContent . shape ) (3000, 1) Now the contents of each post is saved in a Pandas DataFrame, we will introduct NLTK to do word stemming and filter out stop words. In [12]: # import nltk stemmer import nltk from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer # NLTK comes with a lot of corpora, toy grammars, trained models, etc. # A complete list is posted at: http://nltk.org/nltk_data/ # Below we just download what we need here.

DataFrame ( newContent , columns = [ 'Content' ]) In [14]: print ( dfNewContent . shape ) (3000, 1) BACK TO TOP 3.2 Bag-of-Word Representation With tokenized and filtered content, we can then make it into a bag of words for further analysis. In [15]: # bag of words creation using Sklearn from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer count_vect = CountVectorizer () #To count words in a document bag_words = count_vect . fit_transform ( dfNewContent [ 'Content' ] . astype ( str )) In [16]: print ( bag_words . shape ) # this is a sparse matrix (3000, 29161) In [17]: # put bag-of-words into DataFrame, since 'bag_words' is a sparse matrix, we need to run '.toarray()' function # to transfer it into array so we can put it into DataFrame df_bow = pd . DataFrame ( data = bag_words . toarray (), columns = count_vect . get_feature_names ()) In [19]: # print out 10 most common words in our data df_bow . sum () . sort_values ()[ - 10 :] Out[19]: one 4239 apps 4309 people 4721 facebook 4880 new 5958 also 5984 company 6242 users 7358 like 7440 app 11793 dtype: int64 In [20]: # print out 10 least common words in our data df_bow . sum () . sort_values ()[: 10 ] # small sample size means most words occur one time Out[20]: lice 1 node 1 nofsinger 1 defanged 1 noho 1 def 1 noisiness 1 deets 1 deepu 1 nominate 1 dtype: int64 As we can see, the most used words have ‘new', ‘also', ‘like' which are not very valuable for us since these are more common words and appear in most of the articles. We still need to dig deeper to find out more unique words. That's where Tf-Idf comes in. BACK TO TOP 3.3 Tf-Idf Representation In information retrieval, tf–idf or TFIDF , short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. Put in human-readable words, term frequency means some word is used a lot in one documents, thus more important in weight. Inverse Document Frenquency means some word only appears in one article, thus more unique. Combine these two factors and we'll get TF - IDF , the important AND unique words. More details here . In [21]: # tf-idf creation # Good thing is we don't have to dig too deep into how it's calculated, Sklearn already did it for us from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer tfidf_vect = TfidfVectorizer () tfidf_mat = tfidf_vect . fit_transform ( dfNewContent [ 'Content' ] . astype ( str )) In [22]: # convert to pandas to get better idea about the data df_tfidf = pd .

We need to further fine tune our method. In [24]: # now introcucing stop words in the Tf-Idf vectorizer and max/min df # to smooth out some extremes # stop_words='english', tfidf_vect_stop = TfidfVectorizer ( stop_words = 'english' , max_df = 0.99 , min_df = 30 ) content_tfidf = tfidf_vect_stop . fit_transform ( dfNewContent [ 'Content' ] . astype ( str )) print ( content_tfidf . shape ) vec = content_tfidf . max ( axis = 0 ) df_content_tfidf = pd .

We also see ‘wechat' which is a fast growing Chinese ‘Whatsapp' alternative. The word ‘wallet' may suggest that e-payment like Paypal or crytocurrency like BitCoin still have a lot of media coverage. BACK TO TOP 4. Data Visualization To do data visualization, first we want to write some functions that will take in the category name as a parameter, then process the data needed for visualization for that category. So we don't have to repeat the same code for each category. It is DRY , thus more Pythonic. 4.1 PreProcessing Functions In [25]: #Function to analyze any given category. from os import path from wordcloud import WordCloud #Install world cloud using pip. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ; plt . rcdefaults () def analyzeCategory ( category ): raw_data = [] for index , row in df . iterrows (): if row [ 'category' ] == category : raw_data . append ( row [ 'content' ]) raw_df = pd .

BACK TO TOP 4.6 Topics Trend Over Time Being able to know the trend of topics over time sometime is very valuable information. It helps the editors of the website or media to better manage how much coverage each category should have.

I've followed Dataquest's blog post: Building a data science portfolio: Making a data science blog to get this one setup. Here are some insights and hiccups that may be helpful to others who want to do the same thing. Static sites and static sites generator If you have never experienced the web development world, static site might be a new word to you. Actually it's quite simple, it's just plan web-site with HTML files, CSS sheets and Javascript files. These file never changes unless you make them, thus the word ‘static'. The ‘dynamic' site, on the other hand, use database and complex post-end technology to ‘dynamically' generate these HTML / CSS /Javascripts files. It's much harder to develop and maintain. But I don't want that complexity you say. I just want to write something and post them and make them look neat. Then, my friend, look no further than a static site. Good news to us, there are a lot of static sites generators out there that can help us do the heavy-lifting of developing a website. The static sites generators come with many flavors, Jekyell(based on Ruby) , Pelican(based on Python are too popular one. Since I'm more familiar with Python. I decided to use Pelican to build my data science blog. The beautiful thing here is, since Pelican is written in Python, it's quite easy to make it work with Jupyter Notebook, which is a huge bonus for data science. This means you can write your blog posts using Jupyter Notebook, leverage all the powerful snippets, data visualization and code executing it has and roll all those into your post, with ease. Install Pelican Usually install Pelican will be easy, but if we also want to support Jupyter Notebook it will be harder. Many python modules will need to be installed using pip . Here is a list I used: Markdown == 2 .6.6 # Markdown support pelican == 3 .6.3 # Pelican itself jupyter> = 1 .0 # Jupyter Notebook ipython> = 4 .0 # iPython nbconvert> = 4 .0 # beautifulsoup4 # not sure why we need pharsing here, maybe manipulating codes ghp-import == 0 .4.1 #handle git branches matplotlib == 1 .5.1 #data visualization Once all are installed, run: pelican-quickstart Answer couple of questions and the backbone of your site is up. To make the Jupyter Notebook part work, we will need this Pelican plugin (yes, Pelican support plugins!): Pelican-ipynb . Once installed, activate the plugin in your pelicanconf.py . This is your dot file, and you'll be dealig with it a lot later on. Add these into the bottom: MARKUP = ( 'md' , 'ipynb' ) PLUGIN_PATH = './plugins' PLUGINS = [ 'ipynb.markup' ] Write Post Well this is the easier part. Just put your Jupyter Notebook file into the 'content' folder. Also, for each post, we'll need a meta file to include some meta data of the post. The meta file should have the extension: .ipynb-meta . Here is an example: Title : First Post Slug : first - post Date : 2016 - 06 - 08 20 : 00 Category : posts Tags : python firsts author : Vik Paruchuri Summary : My first post , read it to find out . It's quite easy to figure out what they are so I won't bother explain here. When done, save. Generating HTML Exit out of content folder, and run pelican content to generate the HTML . Enter output again and run: python -m pelican.server Then visit: localhost:8000 to see your new site. Putting it on GitHub Pages Create a GitHub Page is simple and there are many tutorials out there. Once created, edit your SITEURL in publishconf.py file, make it into https://username.github.io , substitute username with your site name. Run pelican content -s publishconf.py to generate the real stuff. Run ghp-import output -b master to import everything into the output folder to the master branch. Run git push origin master to push changes to GitHub repo. Themes There are a lot of themes to choose from. What you need to do is to configure your pelicanconf.py file and assign the theme name. Some themes may need to install extra Python modules or have access to other services to work. But overall the process is straight forward. Google Analytics Pelican have Google Analytics support out of the box. Register the site on GA , then get the UA-XXXXxxxxx id, put it into the pelicanconf.py file and you're golden. Disqus Disqus support come out of the box too. Register the site on Disqus, get your shortname correct, and put into pelicanconf.py and you should be good too. Some turorial suggest put into publishconf.py , well mine only works on pelicanconf.py so use your own judgement. SEO Basic SEO can be achieved using sitemap plugin. Search for it and put into pelicanconf.py , it will work automatically. Conclusion Overall the process is not hard at all. Once everything is set. Just focus on putting in solid content using Jupyter Notebook.

Hopefully it can serve as a place to record the learning process/progress as well as providing some reference for others just entering this field. Numpy Basics Numpy is a powerful module of Python. It covers a lot of basics of Linear algebra, and are great when it comes to doing sceintific and mathematical calculations. That's why it is the ‘go-to' solution for Machine Learning. There are other ‘highler-level' and more dedicated modules out there like Pandas, seaborn that also utilize or even built on Numpy. Thus proves the powerfulness of Numpy in another way. Though works mostly on the fundation level, Numpy should be considered an equivelant to other more ‘advanced' modules and whichever fits the most to solve the problem at hand should be used. Without further ado, let's jump right into some code In [1]: import numpy as np # use 'np' to represent Numpy is kind of a coding convention print ( 'Numpy version: ' , np . __version__ ) Numpy version: 1.13.3 Now it's imported, let's use it to do some basic stuffs. In [2]: x = np . random . rand ( 5 , 3 ) x Out[2]: array([[ 0.06584995, 0.58936577, 0.02054667], [ 0.90132301, 0.62575129, 0.76350867], [ 0.70707616, 0.19462487, 0.35358817], [ 0.44329537, 0.57977487, 0.78594087], [ 0.76109628, 0.86614311, 0.51521077]]) Manipulate with array is what Numpy do best. Here we generated an 5 row 3 columns array of randome numbers (from 0 to 1) In [3]: print ( x . shape ) print ( x . dtype ) (5, 3) float64 We can look at the shape of an array and what data type it is. Obviously it's a float since it's generated from np.random.rand. In [4]: y = np . random . rand ( 3 , 4 ) z = np . dot ( x , y ) z Out[4]: array([[ 0.60055916, 0.43108417, 0.35430406, 0.32056793], [ 2.10608162, 0.91944706, 0.73772388, 1.22819697], [ 1.1554381 , 0.48784172, 0.3088563 , 0.63719203], [ 1.66918268, 0.69113499, 0.68490871, 1.04397122], [ 1.95288349, 0.98819028, 0.76639304, 1.09896047]]) Doing some good old dot product. In [6]: z = x @ y z Out[6]: array([[ 0.60055916, 0.43108417, 0.35430406, 0.32056793], [ 2.10608162, 0.91944706, 0.73772388, 1.22819697], [ 1.1554381 , 0.48784172, 0.3088563 , 0.63719203], [ 1.66918268, 0.69113499, 0.68490871, 1.04397122], [ 1.95288349, 0.98819028, 0.76639304, 1.09896047]]) Or more intuitively use ‘@' operand. How to index Numpy array First create a sample array using np.array function. In [7]: x1 = np . array ([[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 4 , 5 , 6 ], [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]]) x1 Out[7]: array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) Array[row, col] represent array element in ‘row' and ‘col'. Note that In [8]: x1 [ 1 , 1 ] #row 1, col 1, since Python list starts from 0, so it's 2nd row and col; Out[8]: 5 In [9]: x1 [:, 2 ] #':' means all elements, so this means all elements on 3rd column, let's see Out[9]: array([3, 6, 9]) In [10]: x1 [:, 1 ] > 3 # an array condition equation will generate an array of boolean values; Out[10]: array([False, True, True], dtype=bool) In [11]: x1 [ x1 [:, 1 ] > 3 ] # This means index the rows that the 2nd column is greater than 3; Out[11]: array([[4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) Shape Manipulations In [12]: x1 . reshape ( 9 ) #reshape x1 into one row Out[12]: array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) In [13]: x1 . reshape ( 3 , 3 ) #reshape back to 3x3 Out[13]: array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) In [14]: x1 . reshape ( 9 , 1 ) #reshape into 9x1 Out[14]: array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]) Dot and Mutiplication In [15]: x2 = np . arange ( 9 ) . reshape ( 3 , 3 ) x2 Out[15]: array([[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]) In [16]: multi = x1 * x2 dot = np . dot ( x1 , x2 ) print ( 'x1 * x2 =' , multi ) print ( 'x1 dot x2 =' , dot ) x1 * x2 = [[ 0 2 6] [12 20 30] [42 56 72]] x1 dot x2 = [[ 24 30 36] [ 51 66 81] [ 78 102 126]] Pandas Basics In [17]: # set some basic data col_names = [ 'temperature' , 'time' , 'day' ] data = np . array ([[ 64 , 2100 , 1 ], [ 50 , 2200 , 1 ], [ 48 , 2300 , 1 ], [ 34 , 0 , 2 ], [ 30 , 100 , 5 ]]) data Out[17]: array([[ 64, 2100, 1], [ 50, 2200, 1], [ 48, 2300, 1], [ 34, 0, 2], [ 30, 100, 5]]) In [18]: # explore the data using numpy, it's clumsy data2 = data [ data [:, 1 ] > 1500 ] data2 Out[18]: array([[ 64, 2100, 1], [ 50, 2200, 1], [ 48, 2300, 1]]) In [19]: # now let's try use Pandas import pandas as pd df = pd .
