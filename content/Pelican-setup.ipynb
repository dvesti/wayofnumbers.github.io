I've followed Dataquest's blog post: [Building a data science portfolio: Making a data science blog](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/how-to-setup-a-data-science-blog/) to get this one setup. Here are some insights and hiccups that may be helpful to others who want to do the same thing."

    "If you have never experienced the web development world, static site might be a new word to you. Actually it's quite simple, it's just plan web-site with HTML files, CSS sheets and Javascript files. These file never changes unless you make them, thus the word 'static'. The 'dynamic' site, on the other hand, use database and complex post-end technology to 'dynamically' generate these HTML/CSS/Javascripts files. It's much harder to develop and maintain. \n",
    "But I don't want that complexity you say. I just want to write something and post them and make them look neat. Then, my friend, look no further than a static site. Good news to us, there are a lot of static sites generators out there that can help us do the heavy-lifting of developing a website. \n",
    "The static sites generators come with many flavors, [Jekyell(based on Ruby)](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Pelican(based on Python](https://blog.getpelican.com/) are too popular one. Since I'm more familiar with Python. I decided to use Pelican to build my data science blog."
