[Anish Singh Walia](https://towardsdatascience.com/@anishsingh20):        
> If your input data is sparse then methods such as **SGD,NAG and momentum** are inferior and perform poorly. **For sparse data sets one should use one of the adaptive learning-rate methods.** An additional benefit is that we wonâ€™t need to adjust the learning rate but likely achieve the best results with the default value.
> If one wants fast convergence and train a deep Neural Network Model or a highly complex Neural Network then **Adam or any other Adaptive learning rate techniques** should be used because they outperforms every other optimization algorithms.

One thing about Machine Learning the overal depth of the topics and algorithms makes it so easy to totally *'sink'* yourself into it. And there is always something to dig. This article provides a view from a higher ground and compare different optimization algorithms and their application areas, thus pulling you out of the deep hole of deep learning. 

A more visual example of these algorithms, see these two beautifully crafted animations:
