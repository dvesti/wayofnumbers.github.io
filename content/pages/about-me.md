I am a Machine Learning practitioner, Product Manager, UI/UX Designer, Web Developer and I also write my own website, web app and manage my own server. I love to read and share my thoughts on technology, data science and design. Technology is fun, but it's like an acorn, you'll have to crack the shell to taste the good. 
Currently writing a lot on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@lymenlee).
